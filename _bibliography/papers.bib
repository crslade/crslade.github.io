abstract="Background: Machine learning models often use passively recorded sensor data streams as inputs to train machine learning models that predict outcomes captured through ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Despite the growth of mobile data collection, challenges in obtaining proper authorization to send notifications, receive background events, and perform background tasks persist. Objective: We investigated challenges faced by mobile sensing apps in real-world settings in order to develop design guidelines. For active data, we compared 2 prompting strategies: setup prompting, where the app requests authorization during its initial run, and contextual prompting, where authorization is requested when an event or notification occurs. Additionally, we evaluated 2 passive data collection paradigms: collection during scheduled background tasks and persistent reminders that trigger passive data collection. We investigated the following research questions (RQs): (RQ1) how do setup prompting and contextual prompting affect scheduled notification delivery and the response rate of notification-initiated EMA? (RQ2) Which authorization paradigm, setup or contextual prompting, is more successful in leading users to grant authorization to receive background events? and (RQ3) Which polling-based method, persistent reminders or scheduled background tasks, completes more background sessions? Methods: We developed mobile sensing apps for iOS and Android devices and tested them through a 30-day user study asking college students (n=145) about their stress levels. Participants responded to a daily EMA question to test active data collection. The sensing apps collected background location events, polled for passive data with persistent reminders, and scheduled background tasks to test passive data collection. Results: For RQ1, setup and contextual prompting yielded no significant difference (ANOVA F1,144=0.0227; P=.88) in EMA compliance, with an average of 23.4 (SD 7.36) out of 30 assessments completed. However, qualitative analysis revealed that contextual prompting on iOS devices resulted in inconsistent notification deliveries. For RQ2, contextual prompting for background events was 55.5{\%} ($\chi$21=4.4; P=.04) more effective in gaining authorization. For RQ3, users demonstrated resistance to installing the persistent reminder, but when installed, the persistent reminder performed 226.5{\%} more background sessions than traditional background tasks. Conclusions: We developed design guidelines for improving mobile sensing on consumer mobile devices based on our qualitative and quantitative results. Our qualitative results demonstrated that contextual prompts on iOS devices resulted in inconsistent notification deliveries, unlike setup prompting on Android devices. We therefore recommend using setup prompting for EMA when possible. We found that contextual prompting is more efficient for authorizing background events. We therefore recommend using contextual prompting for passive sensing. Finally, we conclude that developing a persistent reminder and requiring participants to install it provides an additional way to poll for sensor and user data and could improve data collection to support adaptive interventions powered by machine learning.

ABSTRACT = {Substance use disorders affect 17.3% of Americans. Digital health solutions that use machine learning to detect substance use from wearable biosignal data can eventually pave the way for real-time digital interventions. However, difficulties in addressing severe between-subject data heterogeneity have hampered the adaptation of machine learning approaches for substance use detection, necessitating more robust technological solutions. We tested the utility of personalized machine learning using participant-specific convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enhanced with self-supervised learning (SSL) to detect drug use. In a pilot feasibility study, we collected data from 9 participants using Fitbit Charge 5 devices, supplemented by ecological momentary assessments to collect real-time labels of substance use. We implemented a baseline 1D-CNN model with traditional supervised learning and an experimental SSL-enhanced model to improve individualized feature extraction under limited label conditions. Results: Among the 9 participants, we achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score across participants of 0.695 for the supervised CNNs and 0.729 for the SSL models. Strategic selection of an optimal threshold enabled us to optimize either sensitivity or specificity while maintaining reasonable performance for the other metric. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Fitbit data have the potential to enhance substance use monitoring systems. However, the small sample size in this study limits its generalizability to diverse populations, so we call for future research that explores SSL-powered personalization at a larger scale.},

   abstract = "Objective: Mobile and ubiquitous devices enable health data collection “in a free-living environment” to support applications such as remote patient monitoring and adaptive digital interventions using machine learning (ML). Despite their potential, significant data collection challenges persist, including issues related to user compliance with reporting data, passive data consistency, and authorization. This scoping review identifies and analyzes these challenges, focusing on barriers to effective data collection.<br>Methods: We searched IEEE, ACM, and Web of Science for papers involving training ML models using both active and passive mobile sensing. We used the following search terms: 'mobile OR ubiquitous', 'EMA', 'health', 'passive', and 'deep learning OR machine learning.' We only included papers that collected both passive and active data and excluded papers that used a pre-existing data set.<br>Results: A total of 77 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies utilized smartphones, smartwatches, wearable devices, and environmental sensors for data collection. Several studies reported challenges with participant compliance in active data collection, while passive data collection faced data consistency and authorization issues. Efforts to address these challenges were documented in some but not all studies. Using this information, we outline current challenges and corresponding opportunities for data collection in mobile sensing studies.<br>Discussion: ML techniques can reduce participant burden in active data collection by timing prompts, auto-filling responses, and minimizing prompt frequency. Simplified interfaces such as smartwatch prompts can further improve compliance. For passive data collection, techniques such as optimization of recording times to preserve battery life and motivational techniques to encourage proper device use can increase data consistency.<br>Conclusion: Mobile sensing offers opportunities for developing intelligent mobile health applications but faces data collection challenges with respect to factors such as compliance, consistency, and authorization. Innovations in ML and user interface design show promise for addressing these barriers.",

abstract="Background: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated prompts to capture real-time self-reported health outcomes and behaviors via mobile devices. With the rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, EMA has been applied across diverse populations and health domains. However, the extent to which EMA engagement and data quality vary across social determinants of health (SDoH) remains underexplored. Emerging evidence suggests that EMA adherence and data completeness may be sometimes associated with participant characteristics such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and education level. These associations may sometimes influence who engages with EMA protocols and the types of contextual data captured. Despite growing interest in these patterns, no review to date has synthesized evidence on how SDoH relate to EMA compliance and engagement. Objective: We conducted a scoping review to study two research questions: (R1) how EMA compliance rates in health studies can differ across SDoH and (R2) what types of SDoH have been identified through EMA health studies. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost using two sets of queries targeting EMA and its relationship to SDoH. Eligible studies were peer reviewed, were published in English between 2013 and 2024, and used mobile-based EMA methods. Studies were included if they (1) reported on differences in EMA compliance by SDoH or (2) reported at least one SDoH observed or uncovered during an EMA study. We used the social ecological model (SEM) as a guiding framework to categorize and interpret SDoH across individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels. A qualitative thematic synthesis was conducted to iteratively and collaboratively extract, categorize, and review determinants. Results: We analyzed 48 eligible studies, of which 35 addressed R1 by examining compliance patterns across various SDoH. Using the SEM, we identified 13 determinants categorized across 4 levels: individual (eg, daily routine, biological sex, age, socioeconomic status, language, education, and race or ethnicity), interpersonal (eg, social support), community and organizational (eg, social context, social acceptance, stigmatization, and youth culture), and policy or societal (eg, systemic and structural barriers). These studies described differences in EMA response rates, compliance, and dropout associated with these determinants, often among vulnerable populations. The remaining 13 studies addressed R2, demonstrating examples of the types of SDoH that EMA research can uncover, including family culture, social support, social contexts, stigmatization, gender norms, heroic narratives, LGBTQ+ culture, racial discrimination, and systematic and structural barriers. Conclusions: This scoping review illustrates how EMA compliance rates can differ across SDoH and highlights the potential of EMA to uncover social and cultural factors linked to health behaviors and outcomes. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating SDoH considerations into EMA study designs to capture context-specific sociocultural dynamics. ",
