However, through all of it, computational theory became my favorite course. I know it was not because it was the easiest for me to teach. In fact, it was the hardest. I had to spend hours reading the book and working out proofs and homework problems for each lecture. What was the reason for the switch? I am not sure, but any of the following could have contributed:</p> <p>I did not like the teacher who taught me the subject. He was boring, and it was obvious that he didn’t really want to be teaching this course. His approach to help was saying, “Yeah, that is a hard question. It took me a couple of hours myself. Good Luck.”</p> <p>I couldn’t see the big picture while I was taking the course. I didn’t like the fact that there weren’t any programming projects. I couldn’t see why this theory fit in with computer programming. After finishing my degree and working on graduate degrees, I can see how theory fits into the full scheme of Computer Science.</p> <p>I have figured out that I liked Computer Science (or programming as I thought of it back then) because of the problem solving, not the programming. In the theory class, it tends to be pure problem solving, no typing required. Just a lot of thinking and problem-solving.</p> <p>I learned to appreciate the history of my field, and respect the people who pioneered it. This appreciation has led me to study their work.</p> <p>Anyway, from my experience taking this course, I found that I really needed to catch my student’s interest in this course. The first time I taught it, I started to hear the same complaints I had when I took it. I found myself defending the course. The best explanation I was able to come up with was that companies don’t want mindless programmers. They want people who are problem solvers. Anyone can learn how to program. It’s the people who can solve difficult problems with efficient and elegant solutions that really have worth to a company. If you do that for the companies you work for, you will see your demand raise, and with it your salary and job security. Computational theory develops problem-solving skills.</p> <p>Does anyone have a better explanation on why take computational theory? How do you motivate your students?</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Christopher Slade.
